          "description": "人民日报客户端\n \n                \n8月17日，外交部发言人汪文斌主持例行记者会。\n有记者提问，日前，美国白宫国安会印太事务协调员坎贝尔在电话吹风会上指责中方对佩洛西访台反应过度，试图改变现状，目的是威胁和胁迫台湾；称美将根据长期以来的政策予台支持，包括在台湾海峡进行标准化海空通行行动、支持台自卫能力、强化美台经贸合作、强化自身军事存在；呼吁中方重开相关交流合作渠道，履行负责任大国义务。中方对此有何评论？\n汪文斌表示，美国高官的有关表态，完全是颠倒黑白、混淆是非，充分暴露了美方的强词夺理、强盗逻辑和强权做派。我愿借此机会强调四点：\n第一，这次事件是美方一手策划和挑起的，前因后果一清二楚，是非曲直一目了然。美国无端挑衅在先，中方正当维权在后。佩洛西在美国政府的纵容和安排下，明目张胆窜访中国台湾地区，这一倒行逆施严重侵犯中国主权，严重干涉中国内政，严重危害台海和平稳定。中方理所当然要做出坚决回应。我们的立场正当、合理、合法，我们的举措坚定、有力、适度，目的是向肇事分子发出警示，对“台独”势力进行惩戒。全球已有170多个国家表示坚持一个中国原则、反对美方挑衅，其中包括20位国家元首、7位国家副元首、9位政府首脑、约60国外长以及联合国等10余个国际组织，形成压倒性声势。如果中方不对美方狂躁、不负责任、极不理性的行径予以坚决抵制，尊重主权和领土完整的国际关系原则将成为一纸空文，各种分裂分子和极端势力将会变本加厉，本地区得来不易的和平稳定局面将受到严重损害。\n第二，破坏台海和平稳定的是美方，不是中方。台湾从来不是一个国家，中国只有一个，两岸同属一个中国，这就是台湾自古到今的现状。1978年中美建交公报中明确强调，中华人民共和国政府是代表全中国的唯一合法政府，台湾是中国的一部分，这就是几十年来一直不变的台海现状。但这个现状确实被打破了。破坏者不是中国，而是美国和台湾分裂势力。2000年，美方把单方面炮制的所谓“与台湾关系法”置于中美三个联合公报之前。前几年，美方把秘而不宣的所谓“对台六项保证”公然放在美国一中政策的表述当中。民进党上台后不断推进“渐进式台独”，大搞“去中国化”，在各种场合制造“两个中国”“一中一台”，这些才是改变现状的行为。\n第三，美方单方面炮制的“与台湾关系法”和“对台六项保证”，与中美三个联合公报原则和国际关系基本准则背道而驰，中方从一开始就坚决反对。美方不断改变现状、不断“切香肠”，在虚化、掏空、歪曲一个中国原则的道路上越走越远，试图突破中国的红线和底线。但美方“以台制华”痴心妄想。佩洛西制造的这场闹剧，根本不可能影响台湾回归祖国的历史大势，也丝毫不会损害一个中国的国际共识，更阻挡不了中华民族走向伟大复兴的历史进程。中国人民不信邪、不怕鬼，捍卫核心利益坚定不移。我们严正警告美方，不要轻举妄动，不要制造更大的危机，玩火者绝对没有好下场，犯我中华者必将受到惩处。\n第四，中方事先早已多次正告美国，佩洛西窜台是制造危机，将给双方交流合作造成重大干扰和破坏。美方对此置若罔闻、一意孤行。佩洛西窜台严重损害中方核心利益，中方当然要予以坚决回应，美国必须承担由此产生的一切后果。中方有言在先，说到做到，美方不应感到意外。\n受佩洛西窜台严重影响，中方不得不暂停中美双边气候变化商谈。美国不代表全世界，中方将一如既往积极参与应对气候变化国际和多边合作，继续坚定不移推进碳达峰碳中和目标，积极参与气候变化主要渠道谈判，向发展中国家提供力所能及的支持和帮助，为应对气候变化这一全球性挑战作出自身贡献。美方要做的不是无端批评、恶意抹黑他国，而是认真履行自己应尽的义务，落实早就作出的承诺，不要混淆是非，转移视线。\n汪文斌强调，中方再次敦促美方恪守尊重他国主权和领土完整、不干涉内政的国际关系基本准则，回到一个中国原则和中美三个联合公报规定的正确道路上来，停止损害中方核心利益的言行，为中美合作创造必要条件。\n(本文来自澎湃新闻，更多原创资讯请下载“澎湃新闻”APP)",

          "description": "澎湃特约评论员 王石川\n 来源：澎湃新闻\n                \n8月16日，国家卫健委等17部门发布《关于进一步完善和落实积极生育支持措施的指导意见》（以下简称《指导意见》），提出加快建立积极生育支持政策体系，为推动实现适度生育水平、促进人口长期均衡发展提供有力支撑。\n去年6月中共中央、国务院印发《关于优化生育政策促进人口长期均衡发展的决定》（以下简称《决定》）以来，全国多地纷纷在住房、税收、金融等方面出台措施，鼓励、支持适龄夫妇积极生育。从发放育儿补贴金，到实施三孩家庭住房公积金优惠政策；从明确育儿假，到补贴社会保险费用……这些措施在激励适龄夫妇“生”的同时，也减轻了“养”的压力。\n但正如相关部门所说，实施三孩生育政策及配套支持措施，受到群众的热烈欢迎，同时也反映出希望进一步加大生育支持力度。《指导意见》的发布，既是落实中央决策部署，也是对舆论关切的回应。它在《决定》完成总体布局、各地跟进落实各有创新的基础上，呈现了一张全面而精细的而提供了路线图。\n《指导意见》的一大亮点，就是通盘考虑、综合施策、精准发力，针对婚嫁、生育、养育、教育这些贯穿生育的全程和重点环节，提出财政、税收、保险、教育、住房、就业等积极支持措施。从提高优生优育服务水平，到发展普惠托育服务体系，从强化住房、税收等支持措施，到加强优质教育资源供给，再到构建生育友好的就业环境……每一项制度体系都翔实而接地气，都体现了为推动构建生育友好型社会制度化的努力。\n以构建生育友好的就业环境为例，《指导意见》提出鼓励实行灵活的工作方式，用人单位可结合生产和工作实际，通过与职工协商，采取弹性上下班、居家办公等工作方式，为有接送子女上下学、照顾生病或居家子女等需求的职工提供工作便利；女职工比较多的用人单位应当建立孕妇休息室、哺乳室，配备必要母婴服务设施等。这都极具现实指向性和可操作性，体现了对妇女就业的关爱。\n在强化住房、税收等支持措施上，《指导意见》给出的措施同样精细而直抵人心。比如，符合条件且子女数量较多的家庭可以不经轮候而直接选择公租房。再比如，住房政策向多子女家庭倾斜。此外，实施好3岁以下婴幼儿照护费用个人所得税专项附加扣除政策。\n别小看税收支持的效能。今年3月28日，国务院发布3岁以下婴幼儿照护个人所得税专项附加扣除政策，仅一天，就有超过100万纳税人完成了填报。可见，公众对税收支持是有渴求的，税收支持能真正打动公众。为此，有关部门可继续发力，与公众的刚需形成良性互动，以期求得更大效果。\n《指导意见》还强调，落实政府、用人单位、个人等多方责任。与之相对应的，是要建立对依法保障职工生育权益用人单位的激励机制。向提供母婴护理、托育服务以及相关职业培训、消费品生产的企业加大金融支持力度。这一制度设计虑深思远，既能调动用人单位的积极性，也能让员工实际受益，从而形成合力，助推生育友好型社会建设。\n毋庸讳言，随着经济社会发展到一定阶段，低生育已是人类面临的普遍困境。在这方面，发达国家尤甚，我国的问题也较为严峻。《指导意见》的发布，因应时势，精心擘画，值得期待。但也要看到，生育友好型社会建设不可能一蹴而就，它需要“托底”措施的精准有力，也需要社会环境和社会观念的进一步“优化”。\n从这个层面看，释放生育潜能，促进人口长期均衡发展，不能急功近利，不能把生育功利化，不能把人工具化。换言之，应回归到尊重公民的生育权，保障公民的发展权，推动公民的全面发展上来。\n以此衡量《指导意见》，便能发现其内在逻辑，即每一项制度构建都是通过持续优化服务供给、不断提升服务水平，来积极营造婚育友好社会氛围。有个细节是，《指导意见》提出，扩大分娩镇痛试点，规范相关诊疗行为，提升分娩镇痛水平。这种人性化的制度建设，显然体现了以人为本，彰显了社会进步。这种制度立足点，对优化生育尤显重要。\n“人口是社会发展的主体，也是影响经济可持续发展的关键变量。”围绕着如何提供更好的服务，全力尊重人的权利，呵护人的权益，以此制定出更人性化的措施，尽力而为、量力而行，就有理由期待积极生育支持措施取得更大效果，人的潜力和创造力也将更丰沛地释放出来。\n(本文来自澎湃新闻，更多原创资讯请下载“澎湃新闻”APP)\n\n获取更多RSS：\nhttps://feedx.net \nhttps://feedx.fun",

          "description": "甘甜/中国新闻网\n \n                \n中新网8月17日报道，近来，随着特朗普海湖庄园遭联邦调查局（FBI）突击搜查一事持续发酵，美国两党截然不同的态度，引人寻味。\n一边是特朗普及共和党持续的猛烈抨击，另一边是民主党人的沉默不语。\n向来“你死我活”的驴象之争，这一次是偃旗息鼓，还是正在酝酿一场更大的政治风暴？\n资料图：特朗普。\n美国处于非常危险的境地？\n“美国处于非常危险的境地，这个国家的人们不会再忍受另一场骗局。” 特朗普在“搜家”事件后，15日首次接受媒体专访时说。\n和特朗普一样，愤怒的共和党人也一再强烈谴责，认为“FBI的行动破坏了公众对司法系统的信心”，质疑美国司法部和FBI的调查存在政治动机。\n一些右翼媒体更是直接将司法部长加兰德的此次行动，视为对特朗普和共和党的“打击报复”。2016年3月，时任美国总统奥巴马曾提名加兰德出任联邦最高法院大法官，填补保守派大法官斯卡利亚离世后的空缺。但由于当时参议院被共和党控制，这一提名被搁置。\n被推到风口浪尖上的FBI和美国司法部自是对此予以否认。加兰德在力挺FBI时强调，“维护法治意味着平等地运用法治，没有恐惧和偏袒”。\n美国舆论不断发酵之际，令人意外的是，民主党人却陷入沉默，对搜查一事“几乎没有发表什么看法”。\n白宫新闻发言人直接丢出三个“不”——“不干涉、不知情、不参与”，并一再拒绝评论，“我们绝对不能对此发表评论”“我真的无法对此发表意见”……\n那么，事实真相究竟如何？或许，在充斥着“没完没了的混乱”的美国政治局面下，最终难有定论。有分析称，不论是特朗普还是拜登，抑或美国司法部或者FBI，其各执一词、相互攻击的背后，只是“政党恶斗和权力搏杀”。\n资料图：当地时间2021年1月20日中午，美国当选总统、民主党人拜登在国会山正式宣誓就任美国第46任总统。\n政治极化，美国变成“分裂”的国家\n这些年来，特朗普所面临的指控调查接连不断。按他自己的说法，从2015年他在特朗普大厦宣布竞选总统后，所谓“猎巫行动”就已开始。\n2016年大选期间，特朗普就曾面临民主党人“通俄门”的指控。而他的竞争对手希拉里则被翻出“邮件门”的旧账，备受打击，最终在选举中落败。\n几年后，党争轮回再现。竞选总统连任的特朗普又和当时的民主党总统竞选人拜登“杠上”——情报界人士匿名检举特朗普2019年同乌克兰总统泽连斯基通话时，要求对方调查拜登及其儿子亨特。民主党人随即将其视为扳倒特朗普的关键“把柄”，动作不断，最终演变为弹劾大战。\n而今，尽管还有两年时间，特朗普和拜登等似乎已在为下一次大选 “预热”。“搜家”事件发生后，特朗普私人律师更是直接放话：“如果特朗普当选（总统），他会做的第一件事将是搜查拜登的每一间住宅。”\n为了选票，驴象两党持续交火，政治极化几乎已把美国变成一个“分裂的国家”。而随着中期选举临近，这样的情况，或许只会变得更糟。\n资料图：当地时间2022年8月10日，一名戴着面具的示威者在美国纽约特朗普大厦外模仿特朗普。近两日，特朗普大厦前示威者、记者、围观民众等人流聚集。中新社记者 廖攀 摄\n党争已成为“美国政治中心的黑洞”\n美国党争已成为“美国政治中心的黑洞”，社会分裂加剧、政治冲突升级，“可能会动摇美国的根基”。英国《经济学人》8月10日评论称。\n一方面，由于特朗普极大可能在2024年再次代表共和党参加总统选举，且正带领多名共和党人抢夺中期选举的国会及地方政府职位，“搜家”风波可能将演变为重大政治风暴。\n据美国全国广播公司（NBC），在特朗普站台后，至少有188名共和党候选人在初选中胜出，其影响力仍不可小觑。而拜登政府的民意支持率接连创新低，民主党内担忧中期选举将“遭遇惨败”。“搜家”事件背后，或许不免有打压共和党士气之意。\n另一方面，特朗普的支持者和反对者针锋相对，美国社会面临进一步撕裂。\n在特朗普大厦前，特朗普的反对者打出了“逮捕特朗普”的横幅。与此同时，特朗普被“栽赃”的阴谋论却成为某些社交媒体平台的主基调，还有网友留言恐吓执法人员人身安全，甚至付诸行动。\n对于这样的场景，福克斯新闻主播威尔·凯恩感慨道，“我们看到了国家永久撕裂的样子。”甚至有网友评论称，这次“搜家”事件，“打响了美国第二次内战的第一枪”。\n分析指出，随着中期选举愈加接近，美国两党的政治攻讦愈加严厉，将加剧中期选举的情绪化和暴力化，加深社会撕裂和冲突，也使选举成为暴力温床，可能重挫美国人赖以自豪的民主。\n(本文来自澎湃新闻，更多原创资讯请下载“澎湃新闻”APP)",

          "description": "王明昊/经济日报\n \n                \n近日，美团单车发布公告上调骑行卡价格。相比前两年，目前各大单车品牌价格出现了普涨，不少网友表示，共享单车正失去性价比优势，且价格涨了，“服务并未跟涨”。\n从共享单车企业角度看，价格上调有一定合理性。一方面，前期靠价格补贴打开市场，占有一定市场份额后再提价盈利，已成为共享经济行业普遍做法；另一方面，原材料价格上涨和运营维护成本增加，也倒逼企业涨价。此外，公开财务数据显示，哈啰单车、美团单车均处于亏损状态，涨价似乎也成了企业发展的主要选项。\n而从消费者角度看，更关注产品和服务是否满足生活需求，是否有性价比优势。有网友作了综合比较，目前大的单车平台1小时骑行费用普遍达到4.5元以上。在不少消费者看来，即使仍有便利性，但共享单车的性价比优势正在失去，共享单车企业面临一定的用户流失风险。此次涨价引发的热议，对于企业来说有哪些启示？\n企业价格上调幅度要在用户可接受的区间。无论共享单车企业拥有多么庞大的市场份额和用户数量，有一点必须清楚，共享单车的生存价值就是以方便快捷、经济实惠的方式，补上公共交通系统“最先一公里”和“最后一公里”的短板。共享单车企业应重视用户反馈，始终守护好便捷与实惠这两个落脚点。\n企业的配套服务和保障要与上涨的价格匹配。用户除了诟病涨价，还纷纷吐槽，共享单车如今普遍存在故障车过多、归还点位少、骑行体验不佳等问题，这些都暴露了企业在运营和维护方面的不足。共享单车用户每次出行，都是一次体验测评。如果价格上调，而用户体验却没有明显改善，甚至持续下滑，谁都会觉得钱花得不值当。\n随着近年的广泛普及，共享单车已成为许多人离不开的代步工具，在近距离出行上仍具优势。从这点来看，共享单车行业的用户群体仍然庞大，依然具有较大市场前景。而走过了竞争激烈的市场开拓阶段的企业，要想在赛道后半程跑出“加速度”，就需在用户诉求和企业盈利间寻找到平衡点。坚守便捷与实惠，持续提升配套服务和保障，在不断满足用户需求中实现盈利，才是共享单车企业改善经营状况、实现持续发展的正道。\n(本文来自澎湃新闻，更多原创资讯请下载“澎湃新闻”APP)",
